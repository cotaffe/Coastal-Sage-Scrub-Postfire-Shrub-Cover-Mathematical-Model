# Coastal Sage Scrub Postfire Shrub Cover Mathematical Model
The Santa Monica Mountains are classified as a Coastal Sage Scrub plant community near the coast of California. Plants here, mainly shrubs, are characterized by their extensive root systems, necessary for consistent droughts and regrowth after fires. At the start of the winter quarter of my junior year the Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles suffered extensive wildfires,[At the start of winter quarter of my junior year I could see the Palisades Fire from my balcony, it burned…] burning 23,448 acres in the Santa Monica Mountains, Pacific Palisades and Malibu. As I drove through the same mountains five months later in June, I was amazed by how green the area was, so many plants had already started growing along the hillsides. I’m curious about the ecosystems taking place here: Will everything regrow? How long until biodiversity matches its levels before the fire? Are certain plants better adapted to fire than others? This paper explores a model of shrub coverage in Coastal Sage Scrub environments after fire. 

This model uses data from the research paper, Postfire Recovery of California Coastal Sage Scrub by Jon Keeley and Sterling Keeley, which studied two sites in the Santa Monica Mountains after a fire in 1978. Table One from Keeley and Keeley gives the density and cover of both shrub seedlings and resprouts before the first growing season and then after the first two growing seasons. The table gives cover in m2/ha (meters sq. per hectare)  and differentiates by North, East, South and West facing slopes at each site. Finding the mean and dividing by 10,000 for meters in a hectare I found the percent coverage of shrubs to be 2.7% before the first growing season, 23% after the first growing season and 47% after the second. From this initial research and calculation, I began to fit the model around the coordinates: (0, 2.7), (1, 23), (2, 47).

Due to limited space and other necessary resources, the shrub cover cannot grow exponentially and will eventually hit a point where the growth levels out. Continuing research, I found a paper studying the California Gnatcatcher which gave total shrub cover as a percentage for the gnatcatchers habitat, coastal sage scrub. On average a mature coastal sage scrub has 65% total shrub coverage, this would become the model’s carrying capacity.

## The Primary Model
### Defining Variables:
t := time in years

P(t) := percent coverage as a function of time

The starting formula: $$P(t) = \frac{c}{1+ae^{-bt}}$$

Here, c is defined as the carrying capacity, therefore c = 65 and a and b are found using the following intial coordinates.

 $$(0,\frac{c}{1+a}); \space (\frac{ln(a)}{b}, \frac{c}{2})$$

Primary Model:  $$P(t) = \frac{65}{1+23e^{-2.1t}}$$

The model predicts that the coastal sage scrub community will return to the average mature community shrub coverage of 65% five years after a wildfire. The shrubs in this environment are adapted to fire; they respond by resprouting at the crowns of damaged plants, dedicating a large portion of their biomass to seed production in the first year and calling upon stored seed banks which only begin to germinate after a fire. Given that these plants take around three to five years to reach full growth, it is reasonable that the environment could return to maturity in five years. However the model lacks data surrounding the portion of seedlings that actually reach maturity. The model follows the data from Keeley and Keeley, but there is limited information on the behavior of the plant community after the second growing season. I am personally excited to see the state of the Santa Monica Mountains in five years and evaluate the accuracy of this model despite limitations in the availability of data.

The shortcomings of this model are majorly due to the availability of data and the volatile behavior of the shrubs. Given the size of the burned area, cost and time commitment blocked my ability to record my own data, so I turned to previous studies and preexisting data. I was able to find data on shrub cover in the same area that inspired this project, the Santa Monica Mountains, however the paper only describes numbers relevant to their questions and findings. The paper only recorded data three times, giving three initial points to attempt to fit a model.  I then had to look to more sources to get more information to better fit the model.

Using data from multiple sources is also a cause for concern. Coastal sage scrub is found along the coast of California and can look very different in the different areas it lives. Although weather is very similar in the different locations of coastal sage scrub, it still varies which can affect which species thrive and make up larger percentages of the biomass in a particular area. Other factors such as slope, direction, distance from coast and human interaction can also affect the makeup of various coastal sage scrub communities. Given yearly changes in weather patterns, the year in which a study was done can also affect the data. If research from different studies was done in different locations or years the data may vary significantly. To minimize error I used a data table which gave the total percent cover of shrubs in multiple different locations, which were studied at different times, of coastal sage scrub and averaged the numbers. 

Methods of collecting data can also vary results significantly, Keeley and Keeley describe how their numbers were obtained, counting within smaller plots and extrapolating to the total area. This could cause errors in numbers due to outliers in the specific placements of their plots; placements are usually randomized in order to minimize errors. Other papers had very different numbers when talking about shrub cover and many didn’t explain how the numbers were obtained. To create the most accurate model I decided to mainly use data from one paper, the only number from outside this paper was the average percent cover of a mature coastal sage scrub community. To reduce error as much as possible, this number was averaged from various research on this environment in different locations and years.
